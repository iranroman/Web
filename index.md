I'm a post-doctoral scholar at New York University's Music and Audio Research Laboratory, where I carry out research in theoretical neuroscience and machine listening. 

My goal is to develop machines that can listen to music and speech like humans do. So far, I have built mathematical models that explain how the human brain anticipates and synchronizes with the rhythms present in music and speech. 

I hold a Ph.D. from Stanford University in computer-based music theory and acoustics. My advisors were Julius Smith, Chris Chafe, and Edward Large. 

Previous to my Ph.D. studies I majored in biology, music theory, and German language at the University of North Texas.

In parallel to my academic career, I have carried out machine listening research at Apple, Tesla, Osillo Biosciences, and Plantronics.
