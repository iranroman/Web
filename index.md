I'm a post-doctoral scholar at New York University's Music and Audio Research Laboratory, where I carry out research in theoretical neuroscience and machine listening. 

I hold a Ph.D. from Stanford University in computer-based music theory and acoustics. My advisors were Julius Smith, Chris Chafe, and Edward Large. 

Previous to my Ph.D. studies I majored in biology, music theory, and German language at the University of North Texas.

My goal is to develop machines that can listen to music and speech like humans do. So far, I have built mathematical models that explain how the human brain anticipates and synchronizes with the rhythms present in music and speech. 

In parallel to my academic career, I have carried out industry research in machine listening at Apple, Tesla, Osillo biosciences, and Plantronics.
