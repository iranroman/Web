I'm a post-doctoral scholar at New York University's Music and Audio Research Laboratory. My research areas are theoretical neuroscience and machine listening. 

I hold a Ph.D. from Stanford University in Computer-based Music Theory and Acoustics. My advisors were Julius Smith, Chris Chafe, and Edward Large. My research goal is to develop machines that can listen to music and speech like humans do. So far, I have built mathematical models that explain how the human brain anticipates and synchronizes with the rhythms present in music and speech. 

In parallel to my studies, I carried out industry research in machine listening at Apple, Tesla, Osillo biosciences, and Plantronics.
